![sneaky_logo](assets/img/read01.png)

## About

This project is mainly to spread the love for cats to the world and make it easy to share pictures of cats we like. However we also have the mission to educate people about their own security. Over a thousand of applications are deployed daily on official stores yet we don't know much about what kind of information a developer can get from us in any of those application. With our app as a program outside a official store we want to give people a positive message that can teach them about mobile applications. We count on you by downloading our application and making part of this project by also agreeing in taking basic anonymous information from your phone so that we can give you a feedback about security.

## Technologies

The main program of the project was creating in C language and wrapped in Java to work in mobile phones. Any information obtained from the phone is then delivered into a server where it's stored into a database using mongodb.
